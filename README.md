# 📈 Rossmann Sales Prediction

Welcome to the Rossmann Sales Prediction project! This repo contains an end-to-end data science pipeline designed to forecast daily sales for Rossmann stores. Built using a mix of AWS services, Jupyter Notebooks, and pure machine learning wizardry.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. The goal of this project is to predict daily sales for individual stores using historical data — considering promotions, holidays, and other factors.

### 📊 Key Features:
- Data ingestion from AWS S3
- Preprocessing and feature engineering
- Time series modeling and evaluation
- Deployment-ready structure
- Interactive visualization via Power BI / AWS QuickSight

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Notebook:** Jupyter (IPYNB)  
- **Cloud Services:** AWS S3, RDS, Lambda, SageMaker  
- **ML Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Visualization:** Power BI / AWS QuickSight  

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. *(Optional)* Configure AWS credentials to access S3/RDS resources.
